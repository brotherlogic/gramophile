### Abstract

Enables gramophile to handle wants.


### Process



1. Wants are pulled in the sync loop
2. Gram want add id adds a want
3. Gram want delete id deletes a want
4. Gram want lists the current wants


### Field Requirements

No fields required


### Execution Location

Handled in the same loop as record refresh. Similar process, we pull pages of wants and save them out. Same delete mechanism of syncing with existing wants, with the caveat that RETIRED and PURCHASED wants are not deleted, but maintained


### Config requirements

Want:



* Id - int64
* want_added_date - int64
* WantState:
    * WANTED
    * RETIRED
    * PURCHASED


### Milestones:



* Config added to support wants
* Discogs supports want listing
* Discogs supports want adding
* Discogs supports want deletion
* Gram want add adds a want
* Gram want delete deletes a want
* Gram want lists the existing wants - maybe paginate if we need to
